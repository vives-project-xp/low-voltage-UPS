# Home Assistant

## Introduction

This folder contains the files needed to add the low-voltage-UPS to the Home Assistant as a custom component.

To make it easier to read and understand, the documentation is split into three parts:

- [Development](development.md) (for developers)
- [Showcase](showcase.md) (for demonstration purposes)
- [Home Use](home-use.md) (for users)

The component isn't finished yet, so the documentation is still a work in progress.
Information about the component can be found in the [development](development.md) section.
